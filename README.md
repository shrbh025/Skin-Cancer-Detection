# Skin-Cancer-Detection

## Objective:
To develop an AI/ML model that can accurately detect and classify skin cancer from 3D Total Body Photography (3D-TBP) images. The model will distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions and provide a reliable diagnostic tool for dermatologists.

## Dataset:
The dataset is publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge
